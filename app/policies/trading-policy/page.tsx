                responsible for monitoring your Futures Account and for
                maintaining sufficient Margin at all times to satisfy applicable
                Margin Requirements, especially during volatile periods,
                regardless of whether or not a Margin Call has been made. Any
                failure to satisfy a Margin Call or any failure to otherwise
                maintain sufficient Margin in your Futures Account may lead to
                your positions being subject to Liquidation. Density shall have
                no liability to you or any third party in connection with any
                failure. For more information on liquidation, please refer to

              <p>
                9.8 Client Responsibility for Orders. Any order made by the
                client, even if mistaken, using their allotted user name and
                security code(s) will be considered a valid order for which the
                client will be fully responsible. Cancellation or modification
                of orders is not guaranteed and will be processed only if the
                client&apos;s request is received and executed before the order
                is processed.
              </p>
              <p>
                9.9 Order Confirmation. The client shall not presume an order as
                executed, cancelled, or modified until a confirmation from
                Density is received. Delayed transmission of confirmations due
                to technical factors shall not entitle the client to presume the
                status of the order without written confirmation from Density.
                9.10 Discretionary Trading Permissions. Density may, at its sole
                discretion, allow or disallow the client from trading in
                specific securities or derivatives contracts and impose
                conditions, including scrip-wise conditional trading, as deemed
                fit.
